# Power-BI-report-and-dashboard

In this project, I assumed the role of a Business Intelligence Analyst at AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company and tackled the challenge of transforming raw data into Power BI reports and dashboards to track KPIs, analyze sales performance across multiple regions, identify high-value customers, and analyze product-level trends to identify growth opportunities

To address this, I took the following steps:

1. Data Collection & Preparation: Gathered and cleaned data from various sources to ensure accuracy and consistency.

2. Data Modelling: Built a robust data model to support detailed analysis and insights.

3. DAX Calculations: Created custom measures and calculations to highlight key metrics and trends.

4. Interactive Visualizations: Developed a comprehensive Power BI report and dashboard with interactive elements, allowing users to drill down into specific data points and gain deeper insights.

My report successfully provided a clear view of sales performance, identified underperforming areas, and highlighted opportunities for growth.
